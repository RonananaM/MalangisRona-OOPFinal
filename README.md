SmartCity Planner

Overview
The SmartCity Planner is a specialized tool or framework designed to aid in the planning, development, and management of urban areas using technology, data-driven insights, and sustainable practices. It typically integrates advanced technologies like IoT, AI, GIS, and big data analytics to address the complexities of urbanization and enhance the quality of life for residents.

Features
The SmartCity Planner integrates real-time data, geospatial mapping, urban design, and smart mobility tools to optimize city planning; supports sustainability with green infrastructure and resource management; enables digital twin simulations, citizen engagement, and participatory governance; and ensures security, resilience, and economic growth through AI-driven analytics and cross-sector collaboration.

Abstraction:
Focuses on defining essential features of urban planning components while hiding the complex implementation details.

Inheritance
Allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones to promote code reusability and hierarchy.

Encapsulation
Restricts direct access to object properties and ensures data integrity by controlling access through methods.

Polymorphism
Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while exhibiting behavior specific to their subclass.

Class Structure 

RecyclingMaterial Class
This is a base class representing recyclable materials.

CustomMaterial Class
This subclass extends the RecyclingMaterial class to add custom attributes for specialized recycling materials.

RecyclingCenter Class
Represents a recycling center that manages materials and processes them.

RecyclingManagementSystem Class
The main program class for managing multiple recycling centers.

Methods:

main() :
The main() method serves as the entry point for the SmartCity Planner program. It initializes the system, sets up the required infrastructure, and handles user interactions.

Contributing:
This method outlines how users, developers, or contributors can enhance the SmartCity Planner.

Conclusion:
The conclusion() method summarizes the program's purpose, achievements, and future scope.

Program Flow Example
Hereâ€™s how the methods could be structured together:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    contributing()
    conclusion()
